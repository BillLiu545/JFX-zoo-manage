# JFX-zoo-manage
This repository contains a simple zoo management app using data structures, particularly the binary sorted tree. Functionality includes adding and removing animals, as well as feeding them.

# How does it work?
Upon opening, the user sees an empty tableview for a zoo without any animals. When the user enters in the name of an animal to be added in the zoo, the name is being checked to see if it is a valid zoo animal name. Once valid, a new animal with that name is created and added in the zoo represented as a binary search tree. All animal data is converted from binary search tree into an observable array list for the chart to be updated, and duplicates of the same animal are not added. Removal of animals requires the user to put the name of the animal to be removed, before the animal with that name is actually removed from the binary search tree. When the user selects to feed an animal given a name, we iterate over the binary search tree to look for the animal with that specific name to be fed (represented by boolean; fed=true not fed=false). For all changes relating to adding an animal, removing an animal, or feeding an animal, the observable array list is changed, and so does the tableview.
